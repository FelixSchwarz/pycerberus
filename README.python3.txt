pycerberus supports Python 3 out of the box (tested with Python 3.2+3.3).
As the Python 3 userbase is currently small (compared to Python 2.x users),
I won't make big efforts to maintain compatibility for older versions of
Python 3 (e.g. Python 3.0).

pycerberus 0.6 uses a unified source tree (pycerberus 0.5 relied on 2to3 and
some custom hacks).

As far as I am aware the Python 3 version of pycerberus behaves exactly like
the Python 2 version.
