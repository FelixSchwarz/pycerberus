Installation and Setup
==================================

pycerberus is just a Python library which uses setuptools so it does not require
a special setup. It has no dependencies besides the standard Python library. 
There are some optional packages which you can choose to install:

* **Babel** is the most convenient option to generate the gettext catalog files 
  so you can see localized error messages.
* I'm using **nosetests** ("nose") to run all the automated tests.

pycerberus has been tested on **Python 2.3-2.7** as well as **Python 3**. To know
more about Python 3 support (and its limitations), please read the section 
:ref:`Python 3 Support<python3>`.
