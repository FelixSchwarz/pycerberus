Development Status
==================================

I'm using pycerberus currently (June 2019, version 0.6.99) in several projects
and the basic API (based on "rich results") seems to be fine. One problem is
that I have a lot of code on top of the open source version which should
probably be open sourced as well (e.g. dependencies for formvalidators).

The code is a bit simple, does not have many validators but is pretty solid.
The API for single validators is basically complete, i18n support is built in
and there is decent documentation covering all important aspects. You can check
multiple values (e.g. a web form) easily using a validation Schema
("compound validator").

In the future 'll try to increase the number of *built-in validators for
specific domains* (e.g. localized numbers). Another interesting topic will be 
*integration into different frameworks* like `TurboGears <http://www.turbogears.org>`_ and 
`trac <http://trac.edgewall.org>`_.

However I have to say that I'm pretty satisfied with the current status so 
adding more features to pycerberus won't be my #1 priority in the next months.
The current API and functionality was well-suited even when 
`validating input parameters of a SMTP server <https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/pymta>`_
so I think most use cases should be actually covered.
