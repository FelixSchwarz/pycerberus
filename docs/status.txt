Development Status
==================================

Currently (December 2011, version 0.5) pycerberus is at a very basic stage - 
though with very solid foundations. The API for single validators is basically
complete, i18n support is built in and there is decent documentation covering
all important aspects. You can check multiple values (e.g. a web form) easily
using a validation Schema ("compound validator").

In the future 'll try to increase the number of *built-in validators for
specific domains* (e.g. localized numbers). Another interesting topic will be 
*integration into different frameworks* like `TurboGears <http://www.turbogears.org>`_ and 
`trac <http://trac.edgewall.org>`_.

However I have to say that I'm pretty satisfied with the current status so 
adding more features to pycerberus won't be my #1 priority in the next months.
The current API and functionality was well-suited even when 
`validating input parameters of a SMTP server <http://www.schwarz.eu/opensource/projects/pymta>`_
so I think most use cases should be actually covered.
