pyinputvalidation
=================

pyinputvalidation is a framework to check user data thoroughly so that your 
application is protected from malicious inputs. Also the input is (usually) 
converted from strings to real python data types (e.g. the IntegerValidator 
converts '1' to 1) which can save you some conversion code.

Besides these fairly basic features, you might want to give pyinputvalidation a 
try because...
 * documentation is a top priority.
 * writing custom validators is straigtforward and works without Python magic.
 * the library is independent from its context - you can use it for web 
   applications as well as for any other software that needs to check their 
   input data.
 * the framework is highly flexible - translations can be retrieved from gettext
   or any other mechanism Python supports (e.g. a database).

About
=====

In every software you must protect yourself from user input data which was not 
checked carefully. However many checks are repetitive and validation logic tend
tend to be scattered all around the code. Eventually there is often also some 
code to convert the input data (usually strings) to more convenient Python data
types like int or bool.

pyinputvalidation is a framework that tackles these common problems and allows
you to write tailored validators to perform additional checks. Furthermore the 
framework also has built-in support for less common (but important) use cases
like internationalization.

Internationalization
==============================

Modern applications must be able to handle different languages. 
Internationalization (i18n) in pyinputvalidation refers to validating 
locale-dependent input data (e.g. different decimal separator characters) as 
well as validation errors in different languages. The former aspect is not yet
covered by default but you should be able to write custom validators easily. 

All messages from validators included in pyinputvalidation are translated in 
different languages using the standard gettext library. The language of 
validation error messages will be chosen depending on the locale which is given 
in the state dictionary,

i18n support in pyinputvalidation is a bit broader than just translating 
existing error messages:
 * Using slightly different options for the built-in gettext lookup (e.g. a 
   different domain or a different locale dir) is just a matter of overwriting
   one method.
 * With overwriting another method you can retrieve translations from other 
   sources than a gettext catalog (e.g. a database or an XML file).
 * If you extend an existing validator class, you can still reuse all existing
   translations for the super class without any effort and any influence how you
   want to handle translations in your subclass.
 * Changing all (or just some) messages from a super class is done by 
   redefining the IDs ('key') in your subclass.

All i18n support in pyinputvalidator aims to provide custom validators with a
nice, simple-to-use API while maintaining the flexibility that serious 
applications need.
