Changelog for pycerberus
========================

0.5 (05.08.2013)
- 'allow_additional_parameters' can now be specified in the schema constructor
  directly as well as a parameter for a declarative schema
- new ForEach validator to validate a list of items with the same validator
- InvalidDataErrors can return a list of errors using '.errors()'. 
- added 'min_length', 'max_length' parameters when instantiating a 
  StringValidator
- All validator messages can be overridden during instantiation by specifying
  ``messages`` attribute,
- new OneOf validator to validate that a value is in a given list of allowed
  values
- added constructor parameter 'filter_unvalidated_parameters' (default True) 
  for SchemaValidators to pass unvalidated parameters instead of removing them
- InvalidDataErrors can "unpack" their errors so that an ordinary dict is used
  as container for sub-errors (instead of another InvalidDataError with an 
  error_dict)
- new BooleanCheckbox validator to validate typical HTML checkboxes
- new API method for all validators: '.copy()' returns a clone of the validator
- new MatchingFields form validator (typically used to verify a password 
  confirmation field)
- new AgreeToConditionsCheckbox validator which works like a BooleanCheckbox 
  but enforces a trueish value
- EmailAddressValidator accepts also '-' and '+' characters in local part

API changes:
 - BaseValidator.error() is deprecated now as the name does not really reflect
   that the method also raised the exception. I added a new method named 
   '.raise_error()' which behaves exactly like the old .error() method. In 
   addition there is a new method '.exception()' which only creates an exception
   instance.
 - IntegerValidator now treats '' and None as empty
 - BaseValidator.to_string() changed to BaseValidator.revert_conversion()
   which reflects the actual purpose better. Validators are not required to 
   return a string anymore.

0.4.2 (05.05.2011)
